1) CompareLinearWithNonlinear:
	Compares a linear model with the nonlinear one.

2) SimLinearModelWithProjectionModel
	Simulates the linear model (and truncated one) obtained when settting Projection=1

3) SimLinearWithoutProjectionModel
	Simulates the linear model obtained when setting Projection=0

4) TestPower
	Simulates different cases and the results can indicate if the power
	expression is correct or not.

5) CompareNonlinearWithPALM
	Compared PALM simulation restuls with WFSim simulation results.

6) CompareNonlinearWithSowfa
	Compared Sowfa simulation restuls with WFSim simulation results. (update to new WFSim done)


7) CheckLinearmodelNumerical 
        Compare finite difference linear model with analytic linear model.
