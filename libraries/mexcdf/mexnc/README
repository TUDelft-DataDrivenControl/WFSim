The Short And Sweet Of It...
===========================================================================
Add this directory to your MATLAB path, and you are now setup to use
mexnc.  Check the READMEs for SNCTOOLS for further instructions.  

Please note that mexnc is NOT the same as the "NetCDF Toolbox",
which is something that I did not write and therefore cannot support.



R2008a and Earlier
===========================================================================
Mexnc is only supported on versions R14 and later.  R13 will not pass
all of the mexnc test suite, but that is due more to the way the 
test suite is written than the code itself.  If you want to use mexnc
on R13 or below, you are welcome to do so, but you are on your own.

If you have MATLAB versions R2008a or earlier, then you need to 
realize that you still need the mex-file "mexnc".  This is not included
in this download.  You need to either retrieve it from another download
at sourceforge or compile it yourself (the source code IS still 
included).  You can find the source code in the src subdirectory.

If you are using windows, then you also need to place the netcdf.dll 
file somewhere on your SYSTEM path (not your matlab path, but your
system path).  Something like either 

    [matlabroot '/bin'] or [matlabroot '/bin/win32']

would be good choices.  You might have to reboot.



SUPPORT
===========================================================================
Please note, mexnc is NOT supported by The MathWorks, so please do
not ask them questions about it.  If you encounter problems with
mexnc, you should continue to use the same contact email address
that is listed on the sourceforge web site.



OPeNDAP
===========================================================================
I recommend that you use SNCTOOLS with the java backend if you need 
OPeNDAP access.  Using OPeNDAP via an opendap-enabled mex-file is no 
longer supported.


Problems?  
===========================================================================
I don't have a lot of time for mexnc anymore, but you can still email me
at johne.g.evans.ne@gmail.com
