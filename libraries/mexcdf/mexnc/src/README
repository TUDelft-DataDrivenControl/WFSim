There is only one reason you would need to be reading this file,
and that would be if you want to compile mexnc with netcdf-4 support.
If you don't need netcdf-4 support, then stop reading this and don't
give the contents of this directory a second thought.

If you need to compile mexnc, do the following.  On unix, you need
to check the mexopts.{release}.sh file that is appropriate for you
release.  On R2008b, this would be mexopts.R2008b.sh.  Go down to
the bottom of the file and check that the variables are set
appropriately (it should be pretty clear what to change).  When you
are done, then you can go ahead and build mexnc.  The form of the make
command (done from the command prompt) depends on your version of matlab 
as shown below.

    make           # R2008b only
    make R2008a    # R2008a only
    make R2007b    # R2007b only
    make R2007a    # R2007a only
    make R2006b    # R2006b only
    make R2006a    # R2006a only
    make R14sp3    # R14sp3 only

On windows, start up matlab, type either

    >> win32_make_mexnc
or

    >> win64_make_mexnc
