The Short And Sweet Of It...
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SNCTOOLS is a set of MATLAB tools primarily for reading and writing 
classic model netCDF-3 and netCDF-4 files.  It can use up to three 
backends for this:

    1) tmw, the MathWorks native netCDF package
    2) netcdf-java from Unidata
    3) mexnc, the original open source mex-file

For most cases, snctools <default> support for various read/write 
configurations is summarized in the table below.  


       | netcdf-3 | netcdf-3 | netcdf-4 | netcdf-4 | netcdf-4 | netcdf-4
       | classic  | classic  | classic  | classic  | enhanced | enhanced
       | read     | write    | read     | write    | read     | write
-------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------
R2012b | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw,java | - 
R2012a | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw,java | - 
R2011b | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw,java | - 
R2011a | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw,java | - 
R2010b | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw      | tmw,java | - 
R2010a | tmw      | tmw      | java     | -        | java     | - 
R2009b | tmw      | tmw      | java     | -        | java     | - 
R2009a | tmw      | tmw      | java     | -        | java     | - 
R2008b | tmw      | tmw      | java     | -        | java     | - 
R2008a | java     | mexnc    | java     | -        | java     | - 
R2007b | java     | mexnc    | java     | -        | java     | - 
R2007a | java     | mexnc    | java     | -        | java     | - 
R2006b | java     | mexnc    | java     | -        | java     | - 
R2006a | java     | mexnc    | java     | -        | java     | - 
R14    | java     | mexnc    | -        | -        | -        | - 


There are two exceptions to note.  The mexnc backend is only required
for write support on R14 through R2008a.  If you only need to read
netcdf files, the java backend will work without the mexnc backend.
The second exception is on the win64 platform, as there is no mexnc
backend.  That means that SNCTOOLS cannot write netcdf files on
win64 unless you have R2008b or higher.  You can still use the java
backend on win64 to read netcdf files, though.

"Reading" netcdf-4 enhanced files currently means that you can read
atomic datatypes (such as double and int32) on R2006a through 2011a.
On R2011b, you can also read most enhanced model datatypes.  

If you have R2011a and have never used SNCTOOLS, you may be interested
to know that R2011a has new high-level netcdf support.  Please check
that out before proceeding with SNCTOOLS.

The exact version of the NetCDF java backend depends upon your version
of MATLAB, as shown here.  

MATLAB Version                   recommended netcdf-java version
===============================  ===============================
R2012a:                          4.2 (but not absolutely needed)
R2007b through R2011b:           4.2
R2006a through R2007a:           4.1.1
R14:                             2.2.20

On R2012a, MATLAB has OPeNDAP support, meaning that netcdf-java is
no longer needed as the backend there.  I would still recommend
installing it, though. You still need it if you wish to read GRIB
files.  

HDF4 SD files are tentatively supported in read-only mode on versions
of MATLAB later than or equal to R2006a.

Please add this directory to your matlab path.  You must also have 
mexnc on your path in order for snctools to work.

SNCTOOLS is not supported at all on version R13 of MATLAB or earlier.

SOME ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF

SNCTOOLS returns all NC_CHAR attributes as MATLAB char arrays.  When 
NetCDF-4 introduced, the SNCTOOLS idea for NC_STRING was to return them
as cell arrays of char (cellstr).  But the netcdf-java backend does 
not distinguish between NC_CHAR and NC_STRING, so there was an issue
of how NC_CHAR attributes would be returned via NC_INFO/netcdf-java 
from an OPeNDAP URL vs the very same NC_CHAR attribute on a local file.
netcdf-java returnes them as a cellstr of length 1, whereas the mex-file
(whether mexnc or MATLAB's) returns them as a 1D char array.

The resolution as of r3971 is to return any single-valued cellstr as a 
char array.  Yes, this is a backwards incompatibility.  

There's also an odd case of reading string data via OPeNDAP and the
native package.  If you really need to read variables (string
attributes are read just fine), I would suggest enabling the
netcdf-java interface for OPeNDAP via the USE_NETCDF_JAVA preference,
i.e.

    >>> setpref('SNCTOOLS','USE_NETCDF_JAVA',true)

BASIC INSTALLATION AND USAGE

In order to download and install SNCTOOLS, please refer to the website,

SNCTOOLS PREFERENCES

PRESERVE_FVD
    Way back in the old days, when mexnc/mexcdf was the only game
    in town, data was always transposed when reading/writing netCDF
    data thru MATLAB.  The reason for this was seemingly to make the
    data look consistent with the way that the netcdf tools such as
    "ncdump" presented the metadata.  "ncdump" is compiled in C, so
    it is therefore a row-major-order application, whereas MATLAB 
    presents data in column-major order.
    
    Transposing large datasets can be a costly operation, however, and
    it really isn't necessary in all cases.  SNCTOOLS can be told to
    not transpose data by setting the PRESERVE_FVD preference

        >> clear all 
        >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','PRESERVE_FVD',true);

    By default this preference is false.  If you set it to true,
    you may see a big performance boost for large datasets, but you
    might also end up breaking existing code that expected the data
    to be permuted to row-major order, so you need to be careful
    when using this.

    For efficiency purposes, rather than physically retrieve the
    preference every time it is needed, the preference is stored
    internally as a persistent variable.  In order to change this
    preference, you therefore must invoke CLEAR ALL first.

USE_NETCDF_JAVA
    In R2012a, opendap support is built into MATLAB, but it does not support 
    all possible opendap configurations, such as servers with SSL.  If you
    have trouble with the MATLAB's native opendap software, you can force
    SNCTOOLS to use netcdf-java on R2012a or later with the following

        >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','USE_NETCDF_JAVA',true);

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG Reports You Should Know About

1)  OPeNDAP errors

    There is a bug in the netCDF library that ships with MATLAB versions
    R2012a and R2012.  Please reference the following URL for an official
    workaround.

    http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/854995

    The bug does not affect the netcdf-java backend, so you may work 
    around this by setting the USE_NETCDF_JAVA preference to true.  This
    will only affect OPeNDAP retrievals.

2)  Experimental GRIB2 Support

    If you have the netcdf-java jar file on your matlab javaclasspath,
    you can try read GRIB2 files as if they were netcdf files.  This is
    a bit experimental, though.  And if your version of MATLAB is R2008a
    or below, you should take a look at Technical Solution 1-2Z4RS7 on
    the Mathworks web site, http://www.mathworks.com.  This describes a
    workaround for dealing with a conflict with the ucarunits.jar file
    that used to ship with MATLAB until R2008b.  As of March 25, 2010,
    the URL for this technical solution was at

    http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-2Z4RS7/?solution=1-2Z4RS7

3)  Segfaults on certain strided read operations.  

    Affects versions R2008a and R2009a.  Please consult this URL.

    http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/522794

4)  Empty Attributes

    MATLAB versions R2008b thru R2009b incorrectly disallowed the creation
    of empty attributes, which are quite clearly legal.  The bug is
    fixed in 2010a, but fixes for 2008b thru 2009b are available.
    Please consult this URL

    http://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/609383

5)  Out-of-memory error with negative indices.  Affects R2008b through
    R2010a, but this only affects those who would use mexnc or the native
    netcdf package directly, not snctools users.  Please consult this URL.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Of all the routines in this m-file collection, the most useful (in my
humble opinion) are as follows
    
    1. nc_varget    - reads a netcdf variable
    2. nc_varput    - writes to a netcdf variable
    3. nc_attget    - reads a netcdf attribute
    4. nc_attput    - writes a netcdf attribute
    6. nc_dump      - prints netcdf metadata
