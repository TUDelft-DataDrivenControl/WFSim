Please run "test_snctools.m".  These produce a lot of very verbose
output.  Don't be fooled by any of it, if any tests fail, you will
know.

In order to test OPeNDAP or THREDDS_INFO, you should set this
preference.

    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','TEST_REMOTE',true);

If you wish to test reading netCDF files via HTTP (not the same as 
OPeNDAP), then in addition to USE_JAVA and TEST_REMOTE, you must set
another preference.

    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','TEST_HTTP',true);

GRIB2 support is still a bit experimental, so these tests are not
enabled by default.  To run them, set the following preference

    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','TEST_GRIB2',true);

Conversely, you can disable these tests by setting the preferences to
false.
